# Introduction

### Core definition

axoswap.io is, in essence:

* [A decentralized exchange.](overall-documentation/swap.md)
* [A yield instrument.](overall-documentation/xolotl.md)
* [An AMM framework and staking derivatives.](overall-documentation/liquid-and-liquid-pool.md)

Our goal for development was to address the Cryptomarket's "yield dilution". We designed a system which, whilst retaining decentralization, allows the collective sum to translate into a single, universally beneficial asset.

### Post-launch development

Confirmed project developments:

* Cross-chain bridge.
* NFT Platform.
* Pool incentives from partnering projects and foundation.
* Secret Project.
