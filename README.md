# 👩🏫 Introduction

### Core definition

#### AxoSwap Project, or axoswap.io, is , in essence:

* [A decentralized exchange.](broken-reference)
* [A yield instrument.](broken-reference)
* [An AMM framework and staking derivatives.](broken-reference)
* [A̶ ̶s̶c̶h̶e̶m̶e̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶p̶r̶o̶m̶o̶t̶e̶ ̶o̶u̶r̶ ̶N̶F̶T̶ ̶C̶o̶l̶l̶e̶c̶t̶i̶o̶n̶](broken-reference)

Our goal for development was to address the Cryptomarket's "yield dilution". We designed a system which, whilst retaining decentralization, allows the collective sum to translate into a single, universally beneficial asset.&#x20;

### Post-launch development

Confirmed project developments:

* Cross-chain bridge.
* NFT Platform.
* Secret Project!
* Staking pools with bonus incentives from our partner projects.
