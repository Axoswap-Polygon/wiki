# ðŸ¥… Swap

By utilizing AxoSwap's automated liquidity pools, one token can be traded for another. On AxoSwap, you can either trade at market price, or set a specific price for a limit order!

The exchange charges 0.2% trading fees (0.22% for limit orders), of which 0.17% goes to liquidity pools as a reward for liquidity providers and 0.03% goes to xLT Stakers. The fee does not go to the Treasury or Development Fund in the same manner as traditional DEXs.

In contrast, if you provide liquidity, you will earn the fee.
